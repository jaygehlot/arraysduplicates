# Array Duplicates App

A small example to retrieve duplicates from an array of numbers and print them out, with unit 
tests. 

Implementation goes further a little to calculate the sum of those integers.

Accept an array of integers, print which items in the array have duplicates and calculate the sum of all the duplicate items in the array.

            Example: myArray = [7, 2, 7, 7, 9, 5, 2]
            “The elements with duplicates are: 7, 2”
            
            `mvn clean test` will run all the tests.
